# PetClinic Custom Otel Instrumentation

## [Lab 1: Reduce MTTD with Custom Attribution (Span Tagging)](custom-tagging.md)
This lab walks through adding custom span tags to the petclinic application. You can use this to identify a spike in the throughput of a certain enterprise customer, or the user suffering the highest latency, or to pinpoint the database shard generating the most errors, which will demonstrate how adding appropriate span tags can reduce troubleshooting times (MTTD) considerably.
