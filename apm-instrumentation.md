# Lab 2: Zero Configuration Auto Instrumentation for Java

First thing we need to setup APM isâ€¦ well, an application. For this exercise, we will use the Spring PetClinic application. This is a very popular sample java application built with Spring framework (Springboot).

## Set up Pet Clinic Sample App


Login into your EC2 machine. You should be in the "/home/ubuntu" folder. Verify that by running this command.
```cmd
pwd
```

Next we will clone the PetClinic repository, then we will compile, build, package and test the application.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic
```

Change into the spring-petclinic directory:

```cmd
cd spring-petclinic && git checkout 276880e
```

Start a MySQL database for PetClinic to use:

```cmd
docker run -d -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 docker.io/mysql:5.7.8
```

Next, run the maven command to compile/build/package PetClinic:

```cmd
./mvnw package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

Once the compilation is complete, you can run the application with the following command:

```cmd
java \
-Dotel.service.name=$(hostname)-petclinic-service \
-jar target/spring-petclinic-*.jar --spring.profiles.active=mysql
```

If you check the logs of the Splunk OpenTelemetry collector you will see that the collector automatically detected the application running and auto-instrumented it. You can view the logs using the following command:

```cmd
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

You can validate if the application is running by visiting http://<VM_IP_ADDRESS>:8080.

Once your validation is complete you can stop the application by pressing Ctrl-C.

## Generate Traffic

Next we will start a Docker container running Locust that will generate some simple traffic to the PetClinic application. Locust is a simple load testing tool that can be used to generate traffic to a web application.

```cmd
docker run --network="host" -d -p 8089:8089 -v /home/ubuntu/workshop/petclinic:/mnt/locust docker.io/locustio/locust -f /mnt/locust/locustfile.py --headless -u 10 -r 3 -H http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Enable Always On Profiling and Metrics and Add Resource Attributes to Spans

To enable CPU and Memory Profiling on the application we can start the application by passing splunk.profiler.enabled=true, splunk.profiler.memory.enabled=true and for metrics pass splunk.metrics.enabled=true.

Resource attributes can be added to every reported span. For example version=0.314. A comma separated list of resource attributes can also be defined e.g. key1=val1,key2=val2.

Make sure the application is stopped and run the following command to enable metrics and profiling.

```cmd
java \
-Dotel.service.name=$(hostname)-petclinic-service \
-Dsplunk.profiler.enabled=true \
-Dsplunk.profiler.memory.enabled=true \
-Dsplunk.metrics.enabled=true \
-Dotel.resource.attributes=deployment.environment=$(hostname)-petclinic,version=0.314 \
-jar target/spring-petclinic-*.jar --spring.profiles.active=mysql
```

You can now visit the Splunk APM UI and examine the application components, traces, profiling, DB Query performance and metrics.

Once your validation is complete you can stop the application by pressing Ctrl-C.
